# Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islan
# ds. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands 
# horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all su
# rrounded by water. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: grid = [
#   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
# ]
# Output: 1
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: grid = [
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
# ]
# Output: 3
